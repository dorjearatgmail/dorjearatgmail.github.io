# 3-Hour Workshop Agenda: Building Agents with Azure AI Foundry

**Audience:** AI engineers, developers, solution architects, students familiar with Azure basics and generative AI concepts.

## Part 1: Introduction & Foundations (30 minutes)

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Understand what Azure AI Foundry is and what AI agents are.
* Review agent capabilities, architecture, and real-world use-cases.

**Key Topics:**
* What is Azure AI Foundry: Unified platform for building, managing, and deploying AI agents and applications.
* AI agent concepts: Agents, tools, threads, messages, and runs.
* Role of agents in next-gen applications (e.g., automation, RAG, image design, data analysis).
* Responsible AI and governance built-in.

**Activity:**
* Quick poll: What problems do agents solve in your workplace?
* Short video/demo: Building an AI Agent Using Azure AI Foundry.

## Part 2: Hands-On Setup & First Agent Build (45 minutes)

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Set up your Azure AI Foundry environment.
* Build your first agent using the Azure portal.

**Key Topics:**
* Azure setup: Required subscriptions, roles (AI Account Owner, AI User).
* Creating your first project and agent in the Azure AI Foundry portal.
* Agent playground overview.
* Configuring instructions and tools for your agent (e.g., providing grounding, enabling plugins).

**Activity:**
* Guided hands-on exercise:
  * Log in to Azure and navigate to the AI Foundry portal.
  * Create a project, set up permissions, and build a basic “question-answering” agent.

## Part 3: Customizing & Integrating Agents (45 minutes)

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Leverage SDKs (Python, .NET) and code agents programmatically.
* Add tools, connect to data sources (grounded knowledge), and integrate with real applications.

**Key Topics:**
* Agent customization: Coding agents with instructions, prompt engineering, using SDKs (e.g., Python, .NET).
* Adding plugins/tools for web search, file handling, or code execution.
* Basic integration with apps (console apps, web apps, Streamlit demo).

**Activity:**
* Code lab:
  * Follow a notebook or sample app to build a code-first agent.
  * Enhance agent with a plugin/tool (e.g., code interpreter tool, search tool).

## Part 4: Advanced Scenarios & Q&A (30 minutes)

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Understand enterprise features, monitoring, and extensibility.
* Explore advanced uses (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation, image generation agents, real-time collaboration).

**Key Topics:**
* Monitoring, tracing, and evaluating agents in production.
* Scaling: Deploying agents in enterprise.
* Collaborative development & governance (RBAC, security, compliance).
* Q&A, troubleshooting common issues.

**Activity:**
* Demo of monitoring/tracing dashboard.
* Live Q&A: Bring your own agent ideas.

## Part 5: Wrap-up & Takeaways (15 minutes)

* Recap and resources for further learning (links to Microsoft Learn, GitHub labs, and workshop guides).
* Feedback survey.
* Certificates of completion (optional).
