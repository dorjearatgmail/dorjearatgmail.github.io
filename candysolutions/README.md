# Liquid Mash Website Rebuild

This project aims to rebuild the [Liquid Mash website](https://liquidmash.io/) with a modern, popular style while retaining its original content and menu structure. The rebuild will utilize HTML5, TailwindCSS 3.0+, Framer Motion (via CDN), and professional icon libraries like Font Awesome or Material Icons (via CDN).

## Project Goals:

1.  **Content Preservation**: Extract and preserve all textual content from the original website.
2.  **Visual Replication**: Capture screenshots of all pages to guide the visual redesign.
3.  **Local Asset Management**: Download and store all images locally in the `imgs` directory.
4.  **Modern Design Implementation**: Implement a modern UI/UX with a focus on:
    *   Clear and concise layout.
    *   Prominent display of core information using large fonts/numbers.
    *   Tech-inspired aesthetics with high-saturation color combinations (max 3 colors) and monochromatic gradients.
    *   Interactive animations triggered by scrolling, similar to Apple's website, using Framer Motion.
5.  **Technology Stack**: Utilize HTML5, TailwindCSS 3.0+, Framer Motion, and professional icon libraries.
6.  **Data Visualization**: Integrate online chart components with consistent styling if data display is required.
7.  **Creator Information**: Include `@TonyKing` in the footer of all rebuilt HTML pages.

## Current Progress:

-   Extracted text content from all internal pages: `homepage.txt`, `aboutpage.txt`, `servicespage.txt`, `casestudies.txt`, `connectpage.txt`, `privacypolicy.txt`, and `termspage.txt`.
-   Captured screenshots of all internal pages and saved them in the `imgs` directory: `homepage.png`, `aboutpage.png`, `casestudiespage.png`, `connectpage.png`, `privacypolicypage.png`, `servicespage.png`, and `termspage.png`.

## Next Steps:

-   Organize extracted content into structured markdown files.
-   Begin the HTML/CSS/JS development for each page, incorporating the new design principles.
-   Integrate Framer Motion for animations.
-   Ensure all images are locally hosted and correctly referenced.
-   Add creator information to the footer.
